# ExtendedBalanceMod

ExtendedBalanceMod builds upon LORD-ORION's BalanceMod 1.31 and tries to make more items and skills viable, since the metagame was still dominated by a few main strategies

Version 0.2 of ExtendedBalanceMod adds changes to many Demigods and a few changes to items.

Version 0.1 of ExtendedBalanceMod adds changes mostly to items, buffing many of those that are unviable in vanilla DG or even BalanceMod 1.31. A few items are nerfed, the most important being Journeyman's Treads, Ashkandor, Bulwark of the Ages, Dark Crimson Vial and Portal Locks.

# Download and Installation:

Note that the repository name changed when v0.2 was released. If you had already installed v0.1 before that, its folder would be downloaded as "ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1-main", which could now cause conflicts. If you want to play v0.1, better install it again or rename the folder to "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.1".

- Go to: https://github.com/Schwiegerknecht/ExtendedBalanceMod
- On the main page of ExtendedBalanceMod, click "Code" --> "Download ZIP"
- Locate ExtendedBalanceMod-main.zip in your Download folder and extract it. Ideally use "Extract here", don't extract into an extra folder (see below).
- Put the mod folder into this directory: "Demigod\bindata\mods" or "Steam\steamapps\common\Demigod\bindata\mods" if using Steam. Be careful that you only have one folder "ExtendedBalanceMod-main" within this directory, you can easily get an extra layer if you extracted the ZIP into a folder. Your final file structure should be:
"...\mods\ExtendedBalanceMod-main\Hook\...".

Every version of the mod will probably keep its own branch, where you can download it. Main will always be the current version.
