# ExtendedBalanceMod

ExtendedBalanceMod builds upon LORD-ORION's BalanceMod 1.31 and tries to make more items and skills viable, since the metagame was still dominated by a few main builds and strategies. The versions are mutually exclusive, so you can e.g. have "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.1" and "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.2" installed in your mod folder at the same time.

- Version 0.6 nerfs Mard's Hammer and adds buffs to Queen of Thorns, some gloves and Stormbringer. Diamond Pendant now has an aura.

- Version 0.5 mainly nerfs artifact potions and Fortified Structures I and UB's Ooze.

- Version 0.4 adds only a few tweaks and one bigger Favor Item change.

- Version 0.3 adds a few Demigod changes but mostly tries improving rarely used items.

- Version 0.2 of ExtendedBalanceMod adds changes to many Demigods and a few changes to items.

- Version 0.1 of ExtendedBalanceMod adds changes mostly to items, buffing many of those that are unviable in vanilla DG or even BalanceMod 1.31. A few items are nerfed, the most important being Journeyman's Treads, Ashkandor, Bulwark of the Ages, Dark Crimson Vial and Portal Locks.

# Download and Installation:

- Go to: https://github.com/Schwiegerknecht/ExtendedBalanceMod/releases
- Find the version you want and, under "Assets", download the Source code as .zip file.
- Locate ExtendedBalanceMod-0.X.zip in your Download folder and extract it. Ideally use "Extract here", don't extract into an extra folder (see below).
- Put the folder "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.X.zip" into this directory: "..\Demigod\bindata\mods" or "..\Steam\steamapps\common\Demigod\bindata\mods" if using Steam. Be careful that you only have one folder "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.X" within this directory, you can easily get an extra layer if you extracted the ZIP into a folder. Your final folder structure should be: "..\mods\ExtendedBalanceMod-0.X\Hook\..".

Note that the repository name changed when v0.2 was released. If you had already installed v0.1 before that, its folder would have been downloaded as "ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1-main", which could now cause conflicts. If you want to play v0.1, better install it again or rename the folder to "ExtendedBalanceMod-0.1".
