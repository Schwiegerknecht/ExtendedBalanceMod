# ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1
A very first version to test out. (A multiplier for Spell Damage is not
implemented yet, but pretty much everything else I planned for testing is
there. And at a first glance, that multiplier might not even be necessary.)

# Download and Installation: 
- Go to: https://github.com/Schwiegerknecht/ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1
- On the main page of ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1 click "Code" --> "Download ZIP"
- Locate ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1-main.zip in your Download folder and extract
it. Ideally use "Extract here", don't extract into an extra folder (see below).
- Put the mod folder into this directory: "Demigod\bindata\mods" or
"Steam\steamapps\common\Demigod\bindata\mods" if using Steam. Be careful that
you only have one folder "ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1-main" within this directory,
you can easily get an extra layer if you extracted the ZIP into a folder. Your
final file structure should be:
"...\mods\ExtendedBalanceMod_v0.1-main\Hook\...".
